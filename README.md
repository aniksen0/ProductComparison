# Ecommerce Product Comparison
This repo contain a script for website product comparison, as some e-commerce website doesn't have open API, I have used pyyhon-selenium and beautifulsoup.
This script will scrape the data from e-commerce website and will show the user there searched product price from different websites.



## Extracting job from job websites using search keyword
This script currently can extract Product from the 
```
Daraz
Gadget and Gear (BD website)
startech (BD based gadget website) 
```
To scrape the website used python-selenium. yes selenium is relatively slow, but sometimes we have to mimic as a real user which can't cover with
user-agent, so we have to mask some aof the bot activity using selenium.
